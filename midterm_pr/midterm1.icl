//Students� regulation of E�tv�s Lor�nd University (ELTE Regulations Vol. II. 74/C.) 
//states that as long as a student presents another student�s work - 
//or at least the significant part of it - as his/her own performance, it will count as a disciplinary fault. 
//The most serious consequence of a disciplinary fault can be dismissal of the student from the University.

/* 8. Good Lists
 Given the list of lists and a list of unique numbers. 
 Numbers that are given in this second unique number list are considered to be good numbers. 
 A List is considered good if at least half of its numbers are good. Count how many good lists 
 are in the given list of lists.

 Ex. If you are given [[1,2,3], [1,3,3,4,9,6], [3..6]]  and [1,2,3], good numbers are 1, 2 and 3. 
 First list [1,2,3] has 3 good numbers out of total 3 numbers, hence it is good. 
 Next one [1,3,3,4,9,6] has 3 good numbers (1,3,3) which is half of total length, hence it is a good one as well.
 Last list [3..6] has only one good number and is not a good list. Therefore, answer for this example is 2.
